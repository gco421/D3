    <!-- So far we’ve manually placed the nodes in our graph in a circle. That’s not a terrible approach, but it can make it hard to discern some of the connections. It would be better if we could let the library calculate a more optimal layout than the simple circle. That’s exactly what we’ll do now.

The mathematics behind this approach is known as force directed graphing. In a nutshell, the algorithm proceeds by treating the graph’s nodes and edges as physical objects subject to real forces such as gravity and electromagnetism. It simulates the effect of those forces, pushing and prodding the nodes into new positions on the graph.

The underlying algorithm may be complicated, but sigmajs makes it easy to employ. First we have to add an optional plugin to the sigmajs library. That’s the forceAtlas2 plugin in line 10 below. -->

As we add a node to the graph, we give it a unique identifier (which must be a string), a label, and a position. Figuring out an initial position can be a bit tricky for arbitrary data. In a few steps we’ll look at an approach that makes the initial position less critical. For now, though, we’ll simply spread our albums in a circle using basic trigonometry. The radius value is roughly half of the width of the container. We can also give each node a different size, but for our purposes it’s fine to set every album’s size to 1.

// For the source album, loop through all musicians (line 3).
// For each musician, loop through all of the remaining albums as potential targets for a connection (line 5).
// For each target album, loop through all the musicians looking for a match (line 7).
// For the last step we’re using the some() method of JavaScript arrays. That method takes a function as a parameter, and it returns true if that function itself returns true for any element in the array.
